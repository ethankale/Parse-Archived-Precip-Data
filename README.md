Thurston County Precipitation Data 1988-2000
============================================

This project contains the data and scripts necessary to transform Thurston County's precipitation records from 1988 through 2000 from nearly-raw .HSP files to filled and annotated 15-minute and daily precipitation .csv files in long (one observation per row) format.

Set your working directory to the project root and run main.R to run the analysis.
